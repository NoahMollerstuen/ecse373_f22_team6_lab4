# Lab 4
To use this package, download it into the src of a catkin workspace and rename the repository directory to `collision_avoidance`. Running `roslaunch collision_avoidance simulator.launch` will start the simulator and driver gui. Add a robot to the simulator with the default lidar and control it with the gui. It will avoid running into obstacles.
